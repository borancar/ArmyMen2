 * Both cells are looked up in the per-cell region map, and region 0 means "no
 * region" -- either end being 0 drops the edge silently.
 *
 * The duplicate test compares the destination AND the near cell, not the far
 * one, so two different crossings into the same region are both kept while the
 * same crossing offered twice is not. That asymmetry is the original's.
 *
 * The array grows by exactly one link per call -- a realloc every time, with
 * no capacity -- and the new slot is zeroed before all three of its fields are
 * written, so the zeroing cannot be observed. Both reproduced.
 *
 * The edge is one-way: nothing here adds the reverse. Callers that want both
 * directions call twice.
 *
 * The log is gated on -tracePF, which is what identifies this graph as the
 * pathfinding structure, and it prints the two REGION ids rather than the
 * cells it was given. */

/* 0x00437E00, four callers -- and one of them is ADDR_SETTLE_POINT_IN_REGION
 * itself, which installs the rule and then dispatches through it in the same
 * breath. Choose which of three rules a point gets settled under, from the
 * object doing the asking.
 *
 * FILED HERE RATHER THAN BY BAND, the same call RowInit needed. It sits in
 * pad.cpp..script.cpp, a different translation unit from this file's
 * 0x0042B860 -- but its only consumers are the region walkers, and the
 * settle function it feeds reads ADDR_REGION_OF_CELL. Filing it away from
 * them would cost more than the split does.
 *
 * The three arms come from the tests, not from reading the handlers. A
 * vehicle of kind 5 -- `ptboat` in the unit-type table -- takes one rule; any
 * other vehicle and any roach take another; a null object or anything else
 * takes the third. A unit that moves on water having a rule of its own is
 * exactly what one would expect, and here it is a fact rather than a guess.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THE SHAPE HIDES. The non-vehicle path stores the vehicle rule
 * FIRST and only then asks whether the object is a roach, overwriting with
 * the default when it is not -- so the store happens twice on that path and
 * the intermediate value is observable by nothing. And a NULL object skips
 * the army store entirely, jumping straight to the default rule, so
 * ADDR_POINT_RULE_ARMY keeps whatever the previous object left. Both
 * reproduced.

/* 0x0042B7F0, three callers. Of all the links `region` has to `to`, the index
 * of the MIDDLE one; -1 when there are none.
 *
 * Two regions usually touch along a RUN of cells, so a caller that wants to
 * get from one to the other has a choice of crossings and this makes it --
 * the middle of the run rather than the first cell that happens to be listed.
 * That is the whole content of the function and the reason for the name.
 *
 * IT WALKS THE LIST TWICE and the second walk is not a search for the same
 * thing: the first counts matches, the second stops at the
 * `(count + 1) / 2`-th. Written out that way rather than collapsed into one
 * pass with a saved index, because the original really does make two passes
 * and a single pass would have to decide what "middle" means before it knows
 * the count.
 *
 * The halving is an arithmetic shift of `count + 1`, so an odd run takes the
 * upper middle and an even one the lower -- 3 links give the 2nd, 4 give the
 * 2nd as well.
 *
 * A region with a link count of zero returns -1 from the SECOND guard, having
 * already computed a half of zero from the first. Both exits are the same
 * answer by different routes and both are reproduced.
 *
 * UNEXERCISED, and not for the usual reason -- it is not blind. Its three
 * callers sit inside 0x004049C0 and 0x00407190, the unit movement code, and
 * a Boot Camp drive that walks nobody anywhere never reaches them: the
 * counter reads 0 while AddRegionLink beside it reads 2,109 from the map
 * load. Verified by reading. It needs the same thing the combat path does,
 * which is a drive that gives a unit somewhere to go.
