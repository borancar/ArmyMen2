/* 0x004105F0. Append one message to the outgoing packet.
 *
 * The three gates are re-read each time round, which is why this is a loop
 * rather than straight-line code: after a successful flush the original jumps
 * back to the `joined` test, not to the top, so DirectPlay going away during
 * the flush is caught by the check that follows it instead.
 *
 * Two of the three complaints it can make are pure diagnostics -- a zero
 * length and an oversized message are both logged and then sent anyway. Only
 * the third does anything, and what it does is spin: flush until it succeeds.
 * All of it is inert in this build, where the logger is a single `ret`.
 *
 * The unconditional debug line passes the MESSAGE as the format string. That
 * is the original's, not a transcription slip -- the harness recognises the
 * case and skips it. Reproduced so the two sides log alike.
